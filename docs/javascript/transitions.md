### About transitions

For simple transition effects, include `transition.js` once alongside the other JS files. If you're using the compiled (or minified) `bootstrap.js`, there is no need to include thisâ€”it's already there.

### What's inside

Transition.js is a basic helper for `transitionEnd` events as well as a CSS transition emulator. It's used by the other plugins to check for CSS transition support and to catch hanging transitions.
