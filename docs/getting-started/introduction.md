Bootstrap is the world's most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites and applications. Inside you'll find high quality HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make starting any project easier than ever.

Here's how to quickly get started with the Bootstrap CDN and a template starter page.

## Quick start

Looking to quickly add Bootstrap to your project? Use the Bootstrap CDN, provided for free by the folks at MaxCDN. Using a package manager or need to download the source files? [Head to the downloads page.]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/download)

Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.cdn.css }}">
{% endhighlight %}

Add our JavaScript plugins and jQuery near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag. Be sure to place jQuery first as our code depends on it.

{% highlight html %}
<script src="{{ site.cdn.jquery }}"></script>
<script src="{{ site.cdn.js }}"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

And that's itâ€”you're your way to a fully Bootstrapped site. If you're at all unsure about the general page structure, keep reading for an example page template.

## Starter template

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means:

* Using an HTML5 doctype
* Forcing Internet Explorer to use its latest rendering mode ([read more]())
* And, utilizing the viewport meta tag.

Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags always come first -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.cdn.css }}">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <!-- jQuery first, then Bootstrap JS. -->
    <script src="{{ site.cdn.jquery }}"></script>
    <script src="{{ site.cdn.js }}"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

That's all you need for overall page requirements. Visit the [Layout docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/layout/scaffolding) or [our official examples](../examples/) to start laying out your site's content and components.
