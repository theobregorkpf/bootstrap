## Summary

For a broader overview, see [what's new](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/DEAD-LINK-FIX-ME-PLEASE) in the v4.0.0 release announcement.

- Switched from LESS to SCSS for our source CSS files.
- Added a new grid tier for ~`480px` and below.
- Dropped Glyphicons icon font.
- Refactored nearly all components to use more unnested classes instead of children selectors.
- Non-responsive usage of Bootstrap is no longer supported.
- Dropped the online Customizer in favor of more extensive setup documentation.
