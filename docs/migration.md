## Summary

For a broader overview, see [what's new](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/DEAD-LINK-FIX-ME-PLEASE) in the v4.0.0 release announcement.

- Dropped IE8 supportâ€”v4 is now only IE9+. For sites needing IE8, use v3.
- Switched from `px` to `rem` as our primary unit in CSS.
- Media queries are now in `em`s.
- Global font-size increased from `14px` to `16px`.
- Dropped panels, thumbnails, and wells for a new component, cards.
- Switched from LESS to SCSS for our source CSS files.
- Added a new grid tier for ~`480px` and below.
- Dropped Glyphicons icon font.
- Refactored nearly all components to use more unnested classes instead of children selectors.
